  * Analyzed market liquidity using effective spreads, turnover rates, and Amihud illiquidity index, and applied Kalman filter to study the state-space model of the Hasbrouck microstructure pricing system
  * Utilized tick-level data of CSI 300 stock index futures to establish an autoregressive distributed lag model, analyzing correlations between high-frequency trading and market liquidity and price discovery efficiency

* **Design and Empirical Study of the Registration System Matching Index** (2020.10 – 2021.11)
